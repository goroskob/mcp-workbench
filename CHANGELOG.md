# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Support for multiple toolboxes with duplicate MCP server instances
  - Multiple toolboxes can now have servers with the same name
  - Each toolbox maintains independent server connections
  - Tools are uniquely addressable across all toolboxes

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Tool naming format changed from `{server}_{tool}` to `{toolbox}__{server}_{tool}`
  - Double underscore `__` separates toolbox from server+tool
  - Single underscore `_` separates server from tool (unchanged)
  - Example: `filesystem_read_file` â†’ `main__filesystem_read_file`
  - All MCP clients must update tool invocation names
  - Configuration files remain unchanged (no user action required)
- Tool descriptions now show toolbox context: `[toolbox/server] description` (previously `[server] description`)
- Tool handlers now perform dynamic lookup of toolbox and server at invocation time
- Added validation for missing toolbox or server during tool invocation

### Migration Guide

**For MCP Client Users:**

If you are using MCP Workbench v0.3.x or earlier, tool names will change when upgrading:

**Before (v0.3.x):**
```
filesystem_read_file
clickhouse_run_query
```

**After (v0.4.0+):**
```
main__filesystem_read_file
incident-analysis__clickhouse_run_query
```

The toolbox name prefix depends on your `workbench-config.json` configuration. If your configuration defines toolboxes named `dev`, `prod`, etc., tool names will be prefixed with those names.

**For Configuration Owners:**

No changes required to `workbench-config.json`. The file format remains the same.

**For Developers:**

If extending MCP Workbench:
- Use `ClientManager.generateToolName(toolbox, server, tool)` for creating tool names
- Use `ClientManager.parseToolName(registeredName)` for extracting components
- Tool handlers now dynamically look up toolbox and server connections
