# Specification Quality Checklist: Support Multiple Toolboxes with Duplicate Tools

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (domain-specific terms appropriate for MCP workbench users)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items validated successfully

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-27

**Summary**:
- All mandatory sections are complete and well-formed
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Requirements are testable with clear acceptance scenarios
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Scope is clearly bounded with explicit out-of-scope items
- Domain-specific terminology (MCP, toolbox, etc.) is appropriate for target audience

**Next Steps**: Ready for `/speckit.plan` to proceed with implementation planning
