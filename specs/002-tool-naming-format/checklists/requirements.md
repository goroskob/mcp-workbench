## Validation Results

### âœ… All Validation Items Passed

All checklist items have been validated and pass the quality requirements.

### Clarification Resolution

**Question**: Is a phased migration supported, or is this an atomic breaking change?
**Answer**: Atomic breaking change (Option A selected by user)
