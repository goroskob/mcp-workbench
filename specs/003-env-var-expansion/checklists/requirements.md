# Specification Quality Checklist: Environment Variable Expansion in Configuration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- Specification focuses on user needs (secure credential management, cross-platform paths, environment-specific config)
- No framework-specific or language-specific details mentioned
- Written in business terms (developers sharing configurations, team collaboration)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are explicit
- All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-014) are testable with clear conditions
- Success criteria include specific metrics (100% field coverage, <5 minute setup, cross-platform compatibility)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes, not implementation)
- User stories include detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases section covers 8 specific scenarios (missing vars, special chars, malformed syntax, etc.)
- Scope is bounded through Constraints section (backward compatibility, no shell dependencies, platform consistency)
- Assumptions and Dependencies sections are comprehensive

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- Four prioritized user stories cover core flows (P1: security, P2: cross-platform, P3: multi-environment and defaults)
- Success criteria align with user stories and define measurable outcomes
- No implementation leakage - specification describes behavior, not implementation approach

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Quality highlights**:
- Strong prioritization of user stories based on security and collaboration value
- Comprehensive edge case coverage including error scenarios
- Clear distinction between required and optional features via priority levels
- Technology-agnostic throughout - no mention of specific parsing libraries or implementation approaches
