# Specification Quality Checklist: Structured Tool Names

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

### Validation Details

**Content Quality**:
- Spec avoids TypeScript/implementation details in user stories and scenarios
- Focus is on MCP client user experience and tool invocation workflows
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders understanding MCP concepts
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are specific
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by attempting structured tool invocation)
- Success criteria include measurable outcomes (SC-003: "100% of tool invocations", SC-005: "zero instances")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of TypeScript features, only behavior)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format with specific conditions
- Edge cases cover special characters, validation, and backward compatibility
- Scope is bounded to tool naming refactoring (excludes unrelated features)
- Assumptions explicitly document breaking change policy and compatibility stance

**Feature Readiness**:
- Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories (e.g., FR-001 â†’ Story 1, Scenario 1)
- User scenarios cover tool invocation (P1), discovery (P1), and error handling (P2)
- Success criteria align with functional requirements (SC-005 validates FR-005)
- No TypeScript types or code patterns mentioned in requirements
