# Specification Quality Checklist: Align Tool Identifier Property with MCP SDK Naming

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Validation Details**:
- Content Quality: Spec focuses on developer experience and API consistency with MCP SDK, written from user perspective
- Requirements: All 7 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous, no clarifications needed
- Success Criteria: All 4 criteria are measurable and focus on developer outcomes (zero occurrences, consistency, familiarity)
- Feature Readiness: Clear scope with explicit in/out of scope boundaries, breaking change acknowledged in assumptions
- Edge Cases: Identifies migration concerns, variable naming considerations, and documentation challenges
