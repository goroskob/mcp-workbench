# Feature Specification: End-to-End Testing Suite

**Feature Branch**: `010-e2e-testing-suite`
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "a clean and full auto testing suite. Only E2E tests, no unit, no integration"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-29

- Q: Should E2E tests capture performance metrics, detailed execution traces, or just basic pass/fail results? → A: Pass/fail status only
- Q: How should flaky tests be detected and handled when they occur? → A: Manual investigation only
- Q: Which error scenario fixtures are essential for E2E testing? → A: Core errors only
- Q: What should happen when test cleanup fails (servers won't stop)? → A: Fail entire test run
- Q: Should parallel test execution be considered for future support? → A: tests must run isolated enough (in separate containers, for example) to be run parallely

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Complete Workbench Workflow Validation (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need end-to-end tests that validate the entire workbench workflow from configuration loading through tool execution, so I can ensure the system works correctly from a user's perspective without needing manual testing.

**Why this priority**: E2E tests provide the highest confidence that the workbench actually works in real-world scenarios. They catch issues that unit and integration tests miss, such as configuration errors, protocol mismatches, and user-facing workflow problems.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating E2E test scenarios that start the workbench server with a real configuration, connect as an MCP client, open toolboxes, and execute tools against real downstream servers - validating the entire stack works together.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a workbench configuration with valid downstream servers, **When** an E2E test starts the server and connects as a client, **Then** the server accepts connections and returns initialization instructions with toolbox listings
2. **Given** an MCP client connected to the workbench, **When** the test calls open_toolbox with a valid toolbox name, **Then** the toolbox opens successfully and returns the full list of tools with schemas
3. **Given** a toolbox is open, **When** the test calls use_tool with a valid structured identifier and arguments, **Then** the tool executes successfully and returns the expected result from the downstream server
4. **Given** multiple E2E tests run sequentially, **When** each test completes, **Then** server connections are properly cleaned up and subsequent tests start with a fresh state
5. **Given** an E2E test suite completes, **When** viewing the results, **Then** all workflow steps are validated from configuration to tool execution with clear pass/fail status

### User Story 2 - Configuration Validation Testing (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer, I need E2E tests that validate different configuration scenarios work correctly, so I can catch configuration-related issues before users encounter them.

**Why this priority**: Configuration errors are a common source of runtime failures. E2E tests that validate configuration handling ensure users can successfully set up and use the workbench with various configurations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating test configurations with different scenarios (multiple toolboxes, environment variables, tool filters) and verifying the workbench loads them correctly and behaves as expected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a configuration with environment variable expansion, **When** E2E tests run with environment variables set, **Then** the workbench correctly expands variables and connects to downstream servers
2. **Given** a configuration with tool filters, **When** opening a toolbox, **Then** only the filtered tools appear in the tool list
3. **Given** a configuration with multiple toolboxes, **When** E2E tests open different toolboxes, **Then** each toolbox has its own set of tools and no cross-contamination occurs
4. **Given** an invalid configuration file, **When** the workbench starts, **Then** it fails fast with a clear error message that the E2E test can verify

---

### User Story 3 - Error Handling Verification (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I need E2E tests that verify error scenarios are handled gracefully, so I can ensure users receive helpful error messages when things go wrong.

**Why this priority**: Error handling is critical for user experience but often overlooked. E2E tests that validate error scenarios ensure the system fails gracefully and provides actionable feedback.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating E2E scenarios that deliberately trigger errors (invalid tool names, connection failures, bad arguments) and verifying the workbench returns appropriate error responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a toolbox is open, **When** calling use_tool with a non-existent tool name, **Then** the error response includes the toolbox name, server name, and a clear message about the missing tool
2. **Given** a downstream server fails during tool execution, **When** the E2E test captures the error, **Then** the error context includes the toolbox, server, tool name, and the original downstream error
3. **Given** invalid arguments are passed to a tool, **When** use_tool is called, **Then** the error message clearly identifies the validation failure
4. **Given** a configuration references a non-existent downstream server command, **When** trying to open the toolbox, **Then** the error message helps diagnose the configuration issue

---

### User Story 4 - CI/CD Pipeline Integration (Priority: P4)

As a maintainer, I need E2E tests to run automatically in CI/CD pipelines, so continuous integration can catch regressions before they reach production.

**Why this priority**: Automated E2E testing in CI provides ongoing validation that the workbench works correctly. It prevents broken releases and maintains confidence in the main branch.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring the E2E test suite to run in GitHub Actions and verifying that test results are reported correctly and failures block merges.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request is opened, **When** CI triggers, **Then** E2E tests execute and report results as a GitHub status check
2. **Given** E2E tests fail in CI, **When** viewing the workflow output, **Then** failure details are clear enough to diagnose the issue without local reproduction
3. **Given** E2E tests pass in CI, **When** reviewing the PR, **Then** a green status indicates the end-to-end workflows are healthy
4. **Given** E2E tests complete in CI, **When** viewing the summary, **Then** execution time and test count metrics are displayed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a downstream server in E2E tests takes too long to respond?
- How does the test suite handle race conditions when starting/stopping servers?
- What happens when E2E tests run in parallel and cause port conflicts? (Tests must use isolated environments like separate containers with dynamic port allocation to enable parallel execution)
- How does the suite handle test failures that leave servers in a running state? (Cleanup failures abort the entire test run)
- What happens when CI environments have resource constraints (memory, CPU)?
- How does the suite handle flaky downstream servers that intermittently fail?
- What happens when E2E tests need to access external resources that may be unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST execute E2E tests that validate the complete workbench workflow from server startup to tool execution
- **FR-002**: System MUST start the workbench server programmatically for testing without requiring manual server management
- **FR-003**: System MUST connect to the workbench as an MCP client within E2E tests to simulate real client behavior
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate configuration loading, including environment variable expansion and tool filters
- **FR-005**: System MUST execute tests against real downstream MCP servers to validate actual protocol compatibility
- **FR-006**: System MUST properly start and stop servers between E2E test runs to ensure test isolation using isolated environments (separate containers or dynamic port allocation) to enable parallel execution; if cleanup fails, the entire test run MUST fail to prevent cascading issues
- **FR-007**: System MUST capture and validate error responses for invalid operations (bad tool names, invalid arguments)
- **FR-008**: System MUST verify structured tool naming works correctly with duplicate tools across toolboxes
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that toolbox open/close operations behave correctly
- **FR-010**: System MUST run E2E tests in CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) on pull requests and main branch commits
- **FR-011**: System MUST complete E2E test execution within 5 minutes to provide timely CI feedback
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear test output showing which E2E scenarios passed or failed (pass/fail status only, no performance metrics or detailed traces)
- **FR-013**: System MUST support running E2E tests locally with the same configuration as CI
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate that the workbench initialization response includes correct toolbox instructions
- **FR-015**: System MUST verify that tool schemas returned from open_toolbox match downstream server definitions

### Assumptions

- E2E tests will use real downstream MCP servers from published packages (e.g., @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory, @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem)
- The workbench server can be started programmatically for testing purposes (e.g., via exported functions or test-specific entry points)
- Test configurations will be separate from production configurations (e.g., workbench-config.e2e.json)
- E2E tests will run sequentially by default, but MUST be designed with sufficient isolation (e.g., separate containers, dynamic port allocation) to support parallel execution in the future
- CI environment will have sufficient resources to run workbench server and downstream servers simultaneously
- Test fixtures will include sample configurations covering common use cases (single toolbox, multiple toolboxes, environment variables) and core error scenarios (invalid configurations, missing servers, bad tool names, invalid arguments)
- E2E test execution time should be reasonable (under 5 minutes) to avoid slowing down CI pipeline
- Tests will validate observable behavior from an MCP client's perspective, not internal implementation details

### Key Entities

- **E2E Test Scenario**: A complete test workflow that starts servers, executes operations, validates results, and cleans up
- **Test Configuration**: A workbench configuration file specifically designed for E2E testing with known downstream servers
- **Test Server Instance**: A running instance of the workbench server started programmatically for testing
- **Test Client Connection**: An MCP client connection established within tests to interact with the workbench server
- **Test Fixture**: Reusable test data including configurations, expected tool schemas, and sample tool arguments
- **CI Test Run**: An execution of the E2E test suite in the continuous integration environment
